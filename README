Development sponsored by Eric Forgeot.

txt2tags is a lightweight markup language created by
Aurelio Jargas and written in Python (www.txt2tags.org).

This class here attempts to transpose some of the features
of the Python convertor to the PHP language.

Most of this script was written by Petko Yotov except:

 ⁃ functions PSS(), Keep(), Restore(), RegExp $UEX based on
   the PmWiki engine by Patrick R. Michaud www.pmichaud.com
 ⁃ the RegExp $imgrx based on txt2tags.py by Aurelio Jargas

How to use this script
══════════════════════

This class should be included from other scripts, for example:

    # load the class
    require_once('txt2tags.class.php');
    
    ## initialize a new T2T object: two ways
    
    # either with an existing disk file:
    $x = new T2T("test.t2t", true);
    
    # or with a variable containing the entire T2T markup:
    $x = new T2T($page["text"]);
    
    # optional: some settings, after new/init, before go()
    $x->enabletoc = 1;
    $x->enableinclude = 1;
    $x->snippets['**'] = "<strong>%s</strong>"; # instead of <b>
    
    # run all processing
    $x->go();
    
    # get the complete HTML output including <head>
    $html = $x->fullhtml;
    
    # alternatively, get some other variables:
    $body = $x->bodyhtml;     # only the part inside the <body> tags
    $fullconfig = $x->config; # what was in the "config" area of the file?


Notes
═════

 ⁃ This is an early public release, ready to be tested.
 ⁃ Including disk files is disabled out of the box, because of
   potential vulnerabilities. Enabling it on systems where
   untrusted people could edit the t2t content is not recommended.
   A future version may allow the inclusion of files from the
   current directory or only with *.t2t extension.
   To enable inclusions, use $x->enableinclude = 1;
